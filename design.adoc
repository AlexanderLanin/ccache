`ccache_exe` as a thin wrapper around `ccache_lib`.
Next to it there are `unittest` and `(product-)test`.


= ccache_lib

`ccache_lib` is currently right in the transition from 'everything in one
directory' into separate libraries. This will enable cleaner interfaces
and better understandability of the codebase.

`ccache_core` is what everything in ccache builds upon. Not more and not less.
For example basically everything is centered around `system.hpp` and
`nonstd::string_view`, so that is part of core.

For now `third_party` is completely inside `ccache_core` as it has no
dependencies.
