# This .clang-tidy file is used by CI to ensure that commits do not worsen the
# codebase. The checks and values below are the minimum standard for new code.
# (Without claiming that they are 100% correct. They can be modified on demand!)
# If you want to improve the codebase try enabling some additional checks or
# playing with the configuration values.
# Some checks are highly style dependent. Activating all of them is NOT the goal.
